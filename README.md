# Porting a PyTorch Neural Network from Python to C++ using LibTorch – Iris Classification

## Overview
This project demonstrates how a neural network implemented in **Python using PyTorch** can be **ported to C++ using LibTorch** while preserving the same machine learning architecture.

The model performs **multi-class classification on the Iris dataset**, predicting flower species using four input features.

The goal is to show the process of translating a PyTorch-based machine learning workflow into its equivalent implementation in C++ using LibTorch.

## Project Structure

### Python (PyTorch)
The Python implementation follows the standard PyTorch workflow:

- Loading and preprocessing the Iris dataset  
- Defining the neural network with `torch.nn`  
- Training the model  
- Making predictions  

This version serves as the **reference implementation**.

### C++ (LibTorch)
The C++ version recreates the same model using **LibTorch**, the official PyTorch C++ API.

It demonstrates how the same neural network architecture can be implemented and executed in C++, enabling PyTorch models to run in **non-Python environments or performance-critical systems**.

## Source of the Python Implementation

The Python code used in this project is adapted from the Appsilon tutorial:

**PyTorch Neural Network Tutorial**
